**Features**

- **Modular engine architecture** with clean abstractions for `Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Board`, and `Player`.
- **Command parser** supporting:  
  `play`, `use`, `attack`, `hand`, `board`, `inspect`, and more.
- **Extensible card system** — easily add new cards, abilities, and triggers without modifying core logic.
- **Design patterns**: **Observer** for reactive effects and **Decorator** for stacking abilities and modifying card behaviour.
